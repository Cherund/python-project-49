## Brain Games
This package contains 5 math based games. Which are:
- Calculate this! *(You will be given a math expression, which you will need to give an answer to.)*
- Even or odd? *(Yo will be given a number. You will have to answer is it even or not.)*
- Find the greatest divider. *(You will be given 2 numbers. You will have to find the greatest divider for them.)*
- Is it a prime number? *(Yo will be given a number. You will have to answer is it prime or not.)*
- Find the missing number in progression. *(Yo will be given a progression. You will have to find a missing number.)*

### Rules of the game
After starting a game you will be given 3 questions. 
In order to complete the game you need to answer to each one correctly. 
In case of a wrong answer the game will end.
